# Securing System from Ransomware
The project takes complete snapshot of the last known good configuration of system. On reboot, all changes are lost, and the operating system reverts back to the original state. Changes can be accomplished by first removing the protection mechanism (a process called “thawing”), making the necessary OS changes and then applying the lock (“freeze”).
